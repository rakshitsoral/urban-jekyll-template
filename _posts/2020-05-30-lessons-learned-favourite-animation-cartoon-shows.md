excerpt: So I have been watching cartoons since I was a kid. And I still watch them as they make me nostalgic laugh countlessly without having to judge the characters of the show. This article consists of some lessons I learned from my favourite animated shows and cartoons.  

---

Being a 90s kid, I am a fan of watching cartoons, animated shows and movies. My stint with watching cartoons started when I was twelve years old. I will never forget those days when I used to watch my favorite Disney shows with my sister. Those were the days when Disney used to top charts with a chain of shows like DuckTales, Winnie the Pooh, Mickey Mouse & Adventures, Talespin, Aladdin, etc. TV shows like Fox Kids used to make us children stick in front of the television for hours. Cartoons always make me nostalgic to the point when I used to be a kid and imitate their character. 

Even as of today, amidst all the frustrations of the global Coronavirus pandemic, I am devoting my most of spare time watching cartoons and animes. For me, animation is the best way to release all boredom and stress. While most people relate animation with just fun and entertainment, I think of them as something more relatable, learnable, and valuable. At the same time, I also feel bad for our current generation of kids who can never discover the joy of watching cartoons as we 90s kids did. Nevertheless, with this article, I am going to mention some of the important life lessons that I learned from watching cartoons and anime.   

## #1. Naruto & Naruto Shippuden (Anime)

Trust me, Naruto is one such anime that teaches you a lot about life. The main character, Naruto, is just another kid who is neglected and hated by people for the things he has not even done. So, to be admired and respected by the people of his village, he dreamed of becoming a Hokage --- the leader of the village. Throughout his life, he works harder to make that dream a reality. As he grew, he met with a few mentors who teach him all about friendship, commitment, and will of fire. One of the main USP of this anime is the character development of Naruto throughout the whole series. 

Not only Naruto, but the series is also jammed up with a few characters that make you learn many things. Here’s an infographic I found somewhere that includes all characters and lessons learned from them:

## #2. TrollHunters (Tales of Arcadia)
TrollHunters is one such series that beats the stigma about animated series being the dumb kid’s show. In a world where animated shows are just seen as a source of entertainment, TrollHunters maintains the perfect balance between kid-friendly and seriousness. The central character, Jim, is a 15-year boy who gets chosen to maintain harmony and peace in the city of trolls. The city boasts of good trolls, bad trolls, gnomes, goblins, and pixies too. Just as the few episodes of series pass by, the series takes you to a world of betrayal, horror, and darkness where you will witness some great heroics by Jim and his friends. 

The series makes you learn an important lesson: it’s ok to not belong; it’s ok to be wrong. There are some creatures and monsters in this animated series who undergo various transformations, and the lesson that the writer wants to give is that it’s ok to be them.  There’s no reason to hide who you are, or change yourself to be a part of something.

## #3. Dungeons and Dragons
I watched Dungeons and Dragons on Fox Kids when I was a kid. The show is about a group of six children who are magically transported into the D&D realm through a roller coaster ride at a local amusement park. The dungeon master, an old man around 65-years age, gives these children the direction and the way to defeat the enemies that come across their way.  The main villain, Venger, was a powerful wizard who wished to rule the realm of dragons and wanted to harness the power by stealing the weapons given by the dungeon master to the youngsters. Unfortunately, this was one such show who never gets completed due to some controversies. As a kid, I used to feel bad for these youngsters as they couldn’t get back to their homes. 

Since the show remains uncompleted, I guess there won’t much in the form of lessons. But here I am illustrating some instances from the show and the lesson I learned from them: 

<ul class="round">
<li>The unfortunate incident involving those youngsters stuck in the realm of dragons makes us learn that sometimes, fate just isn't in your favor.</li>
<li>The dungeon master makes us learn that leadership require no rules, only commitment and proving your potential at the right time.</li>
<li>The funniest guy among the six, Eric, is also loud-mouthed and egoistic. For this reason, his friends always make fun of him and take him lightly. However, there were times when only Eric was able to save the group from some enemies. This makes me learned that no matter how weak someone appears to you, that doesn’t mean he can’t do wonders. </li>
<li>Presto, the boy with his magical hat, is a wizard that lacks self-confidence and power to realize his full potential. The show is jammed up with instances where the boy was able to pull some weird stuff from his hat that helped his team to defeat the enemies. The lesson? Here’s something over the top of my mind: never underestimate your ability to come up with something unique, even when people laugh on you. After all, you can always make that sound good. </li>
</ul>


## #4. Shinchan

Oh boy, I love this naughtiest guy - Shinchan. There are moments when I still watch this guy whenever I feel like entertaining myself. He is a mischievous and cool guy who creates trouble in everything he does. He always has witty answers to every question that is asked by his mom. 

For me, Shinchan is a perfect example of how to live your life to its fullest. Even my mom adores his naughty antics even though she doesn’t like the way he talks to his parents. I know she won’t admit to me directly but I’ve seen her enjoying the show with me. According to me, you can always judge the characters of “daily soaps” or so-called popular TV Shows of saas-bahu. However,  you can’t judge or doubt the insanity of cartoon characters for they are created for children who have little to no judgment skills. I think that’s the reason childhood is long cherished for a lifetime. 

## #5. Spiderman - the animated series

Spiderman is one of the amazing works of comic creator Stan Lee. Like any other marvel/ DC fan, I, too, love the idea of superheroes. To me, however, a majority of superheroes seem overpowered because of some weird reasons, but spiderman is different. Spiderman - the animated series is a story about a college-going guy, Peter Parker, who loves a girl wholeheartedly. However, he is afraid to reveal his feelings to her (like most of us do!!). By a unique stroke of luck, Peter Parker accidentally gets bitten by a genetically mutated spider, which gives him some superpowers. As the series went on, our favorite superhero realizes that being a superhero is not a curse but it’s his destiny. Although he was able to gain the love and affection of thousands of those who he saves, unfortunately, he loses the only girl he loves.

Sure, there is a lot that can be extracted from this character, but here are some of the lessons over the top of my mind:

<ul class="round">

<li><b>Your choices make who you are</b> - Peter was unable to save his uncle Ben who he idolizes as a fatherly figure. As he contemplates and thinks back about the past, he realizes he could’ve saved his uncle only if he took the right choices at the right time. 
<li><b>With great powers come great responsibility</b> - After becoming the spiderman, Peter had the option of utilizing his prowess for his personal gain, but he chose not to do so. He is not under any obligation or ordered by someone to help people, but it’s just his way of life to help and save people. </li>
<li><b>Don’t chase your love, but chase your ambitions</b> - Peter loved MJ more than anyone else in his life. MJ, however, was uncertain and unclear about her feelings for peter. Throughout some episodes, she was seen with multiple men but hardly she loved anyone. There are instances, where Peter found it hard to maintain a balance between his professional and love life because of MJ. But Peter still somehow managed to be the spiderman, even at the cost of losing his girlfriend. </li>
<li><b>Don’t let your darker side overpower your brighter side</b> - After some episodes, Peter Parker went hold of the darker shade of power of symbiosis, which enhances his strength and magnifies his aggression. Even spiderman couldn’t resist and almost embraced the darker side of the symbiosis power. However, the moment he recognized the sinister side of the Venom he broke the symbiosis.</li>


<h2> Final Words </h2>

So these are some of the important lessons I learned from watching anime, cartoons, and anmated shows. I am sure, the list is going to be more. I will update it from time-to-time. 
I don’t know about you guys, but I’d recommend I’d not bore you with the philosophy anymore but I’d like you to take some time off for yourself and watch your favorite cartoon show every week or at least once a month. Observe how it feels to act like a child and smile while you’re doing something that the world considers lame or childish. Trust me you’d feel better and happier.
