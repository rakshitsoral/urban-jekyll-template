        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p class="editable" style="font-size: 1.38rem"> I am a 26 year old accidental Engineer turned Digital Marketer who possess a
          natural flare for being able to drive organic and paid conversions through
          Content Marketing funnels, SEO, Influencer relationships, and Pay-per click
          campaigns(PPC).</p>
          <p>I grew up as a shy, underconfident and timid boy in my hometown, Chittorgarh (Rajasthan). I then went on to pursue bachelors degree in Computer Science Engineering at Rajasthan Technical University, Kota. It was there when I learned some people skills, made some good friends, enjoyed my life as a bachelor. Attending classes each day, being completely independent for the first time, living and enjoying with new friends -- it's not everyday you get such an opportunity.</p>

        <h2>Where Life get me today?</h2>
        <p class="editable" style="font-size: 1.38rem"> It was my college life which changed me as a person. I learned how to being independent, cook delicious food, how to do personal chores etc. And then 'real-life' hit me hard. Initially, I struggled a bit to find a job and when I found one, I sticked to it but not for long time. While I'd love nothing more than a chance to get back to my school and college life and enjoy every bit of it as a student and bachelor. But, switching between jobs and changing places has allowed me to develop a clarity of thoughts which I am glad that I developed over a period of time. My work experience has offered me a fantastic opportunity to
          learn and experiment, refining my craft in the process. </p>
          <p>Working in both B2B and B2C environments, Iâ€™ve learned to develop dynamic websites using HTML/ CSS,
          WordPress, Webflow, Github Pages/ Netlify as a CMS, performed Search
          Engine Optimization (SEO) to generate organic traffic, implemented
          relevant CTAs to generate leads, and developed value-adding email
          marketing strategies to help nurture them.</p>

        <h2>The Why</h2>
        <p class="editable" style="font-size: 1.38rem"> So the paras above explained who am I and where I am today. Now is the time to get the 'Why'. WHen I first created my website, it was nothing just a medium to get me my next job in which I was quite successful. </p>
        <p>I am sure you might've heard a number of times: our whole life revolves around studying, getting a good job, getting married and have kids. We all get so much caught in the rat race of this so-called "life" that we care lesser to make a life which lets sus to grow as a person. This is the direction I'm aiming to take this blog. My goal with this website is to experiment, learn, make notes and share the results with others. And I hope to stick with it for a longer period of time.</p>
        <p>I'd love if you be the first one to join me on my Journey. Head over to the 'contact' page and send me a message. Or Subscribe to my Blog as I am going to share whatever I've learned as a professional and a person.</p>
        <p>Cheers!</p>
