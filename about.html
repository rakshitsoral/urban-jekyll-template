<h2 class="title-text home">The Blogger</h2>          <p style="color: white">Hey, there! I am <a href="https://twitter.com/RakshitSoral" target="_blank">Rakshit Soral</a>, the blogger of this website. Professionally, I am a hybrid marketer: an individual who understands marketing and technology.</p>

<p style="color: white">I started my SEO internship as a college freshman in the year 2015. Fast forward after 3-4 months, I got an opportunity to work on a website development project; learning which developed my technical skills. Though I could continue working as a developer and earn a hefty paycheck, destiny had something else in store.</p>

<p style="color: white">I continued my marketing career, for I believe the best people in the world are great marketers. It's their ability to get involved in the community, craft buyer journeys and lure people with storytelling skills, which makes them stand out from others.</p>

<p style="color: white">In 2017, I joined Simform as an Inbound marketer. 2 years later, I was promoted as a content campaign manager for two Technology verticals. As a senior content strategist, I pioneered the foundation of a location-specific microsite and generated highly-qualified leads through my content marketing strategy.</p>

<p style="color: white">When I'm not brainstorming ideas or crafting a marketing strategy, you'll find me listening and singing my favorite songs or researching my latest obsession (Growth and Performance Marketing).</p>

<h2 class="title-text home">The Blog</h2>
          <p style="color: white">This blog is a place where I pour out my random epiphanies on life, profession, and experiences. You won’t find anything fancy here, but what you’ll surely find are the thoughts I share from time to time. </p>
