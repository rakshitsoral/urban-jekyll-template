        <h2>Let me tell you a bit about me</h2>
        <p class="editable" style="font-size: 1.38rem"> I am a 26 year old accidental Engineer turned Digital Marketer -- who possess a
          natural flair for being able to drive organic and paid conversions through
          Content Marketing funnels, SEO, Influencer relationships, and Pay-per click
          campaigns(PPC).</p>
          <p>I grew up as a shy, underconfident and timid boy in my hometown, Chittorgarh (Rajasthan). After completing my Senior Secondary Education (12th, PCMC), I went on to pursue a bachelors degree in Computer Science Engineering from Rajasthan Technical University, Kota. It was only Kota, where I learned some people skills, made some good friends, enjoyed my life as a bachelor. Attending classes each day, being completely independent for the first time, living and enjoying with new friends -- it's not everyday you get such an opportunity.</p>

        <h2>The "Real Life"</h2>
        <p class="editable" style="font-size: 1.38rem"> It was my college life which changed me as a person. I learned how to being independent, cook delicious food, do my personal chores etc. After completing my bachelors degree was the time for me to get a job, become financially independent (I was dependent on my parents till my college), live life on my terms etc. Initially, I struggled a bit to find a job and when I found one, I sticked to it but not for so long time. I juggled between few jobs, brushed-up my computer skills, own a blog and got a job as an online marketer. Although, I know a bit of coding stuffs (which I learned as an intern at some company), I feel that Coding was never a thing worth of my passion, let alone a hobby. All of these experiences are worth a tale for some another day. But I'd admit that switching jobs, brushing-off my skills, and changing places has allowed me to develop a clarity of thoughts (atleast what I am capable to do and what I not. Sigh!). My work experience has offered me a fantastic opportunity to
          learn and experiment, refining my craft over the process. </p>
          <p>Working in both B2B and B2C environments, Iâ€™ve learned to develop dynamic websites using HTML/ CSS,
          WordPress, Webflow, Github Pages/ Netlify as a CMS, performed Search
          Engine Optimization (SEO) to generate organic traffic, implemented
          relevant CTAs to generate leads, and developed value-adding email
          marketing strategies to help nurture them.</p>

        <h2>Let's cut to the chase</h2>
        <p class="editable" style="font-size: 1.38rem"> Enough of struggles, let's not beat around the bushes and get straight to the 'Why': Why this blog?</p><p>When I first created <a href="https://huntfordigital.com/" target="_blank">my website</a>, I failed to stick to it due to the habit of procastination and not keeping up the pace.</p>
        <p>I am sure, you might've heard this for a number of times: our whole life goes revolves studying, getting a good job, getting married, planning family and what not. We all get so much caught in the rat race that we care lesser to make a life that makes us grow as a person. This is the direction I'm aiming to take this blog. My goal with this website is to experiment, learn, make notes and share the results with others. And I hope to stick with it for a longer period of time.</p>
        <p>I'd love if you be the first one to join me on my Journey. Head over to the 'contact' page and send me a message. Or subscribe to my Blog as I am going to share whatever I've learned as a professional and a person.</p>
        <p>Cheers!</p>
