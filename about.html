            <p>I started my SEO internship as a college freshman in the year 2015. Fast forward after 3-4 months, I begged an opportunity to work on a website development project; a learning which developed my technical skills. Though I could continue working as a developer and earn a hefty paycheck, destiny had something else in store. 
              </p>
              <p>I continued my marketing career, for I believe the best people in the world are great marketers. It's their ability to get involved in community, craft buyer journeys and lure them with storytelling skills -- that make them stand out from others.
                </p>
                <p>On the professional front, I call myself a Hybrid marketer: an individual who understands marketing and technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>In 2017, I joined Simform as an Inbound marketer. 2 years later, I was promoted as content campaign manager for two Technology verticals. As senior content strategist, I pioneered the foundation of a location-specific microsite and generated highly-qualified leads through my content marketing strategy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>When I'm not brainstorming ideas or crafting a marketing strategy, you'll find me listening and singing my favorite songs or researching my latest obsession (Growth and Performance Marketing).
                      </p>
                      <p>I still love to collaborate on new ideas, so if you've got an interesting side project, please shoot me a message on <a href="/contact/" target="_blank">contact form </a> of this website. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Sayonaara!
