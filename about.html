        <h4>A Digital Marketer based in India</h4>
        <p>
          As a professional marketing personnel, I possess a natural flair for
          being able to drive organic and paid conversions through Content
          Marketing funnels, SEO, Influencer relationships, and Pay-per click
          campaigns(PPC).

          Through my experience of working at diverse domains (B2B and B2C), my
          understanding and knowledge of SEO, Content Marketing and Lead
          Generation has evolved and I discovered my passion of using
          technology, marketing and story-telling skills to help brands raise
          awareness and generate leads.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have since moved twice: from Kota to Jaipur and from Jaipur to
          Ahmedabad, and now I am working at Simform as an Inbound B2B marketer.

          When I first created my website, I failed to stick to it due to the
          habit of procastination and not keeping up the pace.

          I am sure, you might've heard this for a number of times: our whole
          life goes revolves studying, getting a good job, getting married,
          planning family and what not. We all get so much caught in the rat
          race that we care lesser to make a life that makes us grow as a
          person. This is the direction I'm aiming to take this blog. My goal
          with this website is to experiment, learn, make notes and share the
          results with others. And I hope to stick with it for a longer period
          of time.

          I'd love if you be the first one to join me on my Journey. Head over
          to the 'contact' page and send me a message. Or subscribe to my Blog
          as I am going to share whatever I've learned as a professional and a
          person. Cheers!
